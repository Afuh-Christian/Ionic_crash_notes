# the code below would work on a mobile device with the use of capacitor .... 

# .ts
  opehomepage() {
    window.open(this.movie.homepage)
  }

# .html 
#<ion-button expand="full" (click)="opehomepage()">Open Homepage</ion-button>

... 
- This will only work when we are dealing with the web .... 
- But will need capacitor to be able to work on mobile devices ...
